clojure.core.rrb-vector\n\n  \"An implementation of the confluently persistent vector data\n  structure introduced in Bagwell, Rompf, \\\"RRB-Trees: Efficient\n  Immutable Vectors\\\", EPFL-REPORT-169879, September, 2011.\n\n  RRB-Trees build upon Clojure's PersistentVectors, adding logarithmic\n  time concatenation and slicing.\n\n  The main API entry points are clojure.core.rrb-vector/catvec,\n  performing vector concatenation, and clojure.core.rrb-vector/subvec,\n  which produces a new vector containing the appropriate subrange of\n  the input vector (in contrast to cljs.core/subvec, which returns a\n  view on the input vector).\n\n  The implementation allows for seamless interoperability with\n  cljs.core/PersistentVector and cljs.core.Subvec instances:\n  clojure.core.rrb-vector/catvec and clojure.core.rrb-vector/subvec\n  convert their inputs to clojure.core.rrb-vector.rrbt/Vector\n  instances whenever necessary (this is a very fast constant time\n  operation for PersistentVector; for Subvec it is O(log n), where n\n  is the size of the underlying vector).\n\n  clojure.core.rrb-vector also exports its own versions of vector and\n
